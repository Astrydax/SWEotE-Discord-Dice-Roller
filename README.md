#Running the bot

Before you first launch the bot you need to run the file "Run this before first launch". You can't miss it. This will install all the dependencies that bot needs to run.

To run the bot, Just execute the file "EotE Dice Roller.lnk". You can copy/move this file to any location you want. However, do not move "start.bat" out of the installation folder.

#Configuration File config.json

  config.json has four properties

  1. token
    - this is the login token for your bot
  2. prefix
    - this is the symbol the bot uses to recognize commands. This is set to "!" by default
  3. descriptorPrenpend
    - Any text you place between the double quotes following this property will be prepended to the text provided in the comment parameter.
    Example: if "descriptorPrepend" is set to "Targeting: ", then the command !roll 2g 2blk "Soldier 1" is called, the bot will respond with:     Targeting: Soldier 1
    Astrydax roll results:    Success: 1   Threat: 1
  4. maxRollsPerDie
    - This is the max number per dice type that can be rolled in a given roll command. Set to 20 by default. Commands that don't respect the roll limit will be aborted and send an error message to the discord chat.
